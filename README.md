# ðŸ“¢ Note to Incubyte Team

I wanted to provide some context regarding my submission.

Due to an unexpected medical emergency in my family (a close member suffered a rib fracture and required hospital visits and care), I was only left with two days to work on this assessment. Because of the time constraints, I made the following decisions:

- I chose to keep the frontend and backend repositories separate. This ensures cleaner code organization, no commit interference, and easier maintainability.
- For the frontend, I had to rely heavily on AI tools (primarily Claude SONET 4) to accelerate the development process within the limited time. I carefully reviewed all AI-generated code before integrating it.
- While I successfully implemented all required frontend functionality, I was not able to include **FRONTEND TEST CASES** due to time limitations.
- On the backend, I followed a TDD approach with Jest and Supertest, so the backend is well-covered with tests.

I hope this clarifies my approach and the trade-offs I made given the situation. Thank you for understanding.

Sincerely,
Mohammad

## TDD Backend

A **Node.js** + **Express** backend application for managing a Sweet Shop, built with **TDD** using **Jest** and **Supertest**. It provides authentication, sweet management, purchasing, and admin-only restocking/deletion functionality.

## Project Overview [SWEET SHOP](https://sweet-shop-iota.vercel.app)

This project demonstrates a fully tested REST API for a Sweet Shop using the **Red-Green-Refactor TDD cycle**.  

- Users can **register** and **login**.  
- Authenticated users can **view** and **search sweets**.  
- Users can **purchase sweets**.  
- Admins can **add, update, restock, and delete sweets**.  
- Token-based **JWT authentication** secures endpoints.  
- Project follows **SOLID principles** for maintainable code.  

---

## Features

- User authentication with JWT  
- CRUD operations for sweets  
- Purchase sweets with stock validation  
- Admin-only operations: delete & restock sweets  
- Unit & integration tests with Jest + Supertest  

---

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose  
- **Testing:** Jest, Supertest  
- **Authentication:** JWT  
- **Environment:** dotenv

### My AI Usage

During the development of this project, ChatGPT was used for:

- Generating boilerplate for controllers and routes.
- Providing guidance on TDD structure and test-writing.
- Suggesting JWT authentication patterns and middleware setup.
- Reviewing commit message conventions and project refactoring.

All implementation and modifications were manually reviewed and adapted to fit the project requirements.


***Reflection***
Using AI sped up my workflow significantly, especially since I had only a couple of days to complete the assessment.
However, I made sure to review and edit all generated code before integrating it, ensuring I understood each part.
Without AI, I wouldnâ€™t have been able to finish the frontend and backend within the limited time, but I retained full control over the logic and design choices.
