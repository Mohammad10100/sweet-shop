### My AI Usage

During the development of this project, ChatGPT was used for:

- Generating boilerplate for controllers and routes.
- Providing guidance on TDD structure and test-writing.
- Suggesting JWT authentication patterns and middleware setup.
- Reviewing commit message conventions and project refactoring.

All implementation and modifications were manually reviewed and adapted to fit the project requirements.
